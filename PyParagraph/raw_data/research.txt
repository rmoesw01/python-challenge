Mangold and Faulds (2009) describe â€•social media as the set of online word of mouth forums which
includes blogs, discussion boards, forums or social networks to name a few. Using all mobile and web-based
technologies, social media creates highly interactive platforms by bringing together individuals and creating
communities. Internet has a lot of websites; each of them has different functional attributes and caters to
different sections of society. Websites like facebook are for general masses but LinkedIn is focused on
professional networking. Media sharing sites (i.e. YouTube, Picassa and Flickr) or blogging platforms (i.e.
blogspot, wordpress) are also members of this ecosystem called social media (Kietzmann et al., 2011).Social
media has equipped the organization to establish an direct relationship with the consumers. Both of the
organizations and consumers are free to generate content on the web pages, which further leads to conversations
and discussion. Organization on one end are provided with an opportunity to share their information with a large
base of customers and on the other end consumers are also free to publish any content whether positive or
negative regarding the information.
